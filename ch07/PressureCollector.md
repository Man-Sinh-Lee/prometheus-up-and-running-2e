Pressure Collector:
Prometheus metrics are a way to expose and collect metrics data, often used in monitoring systems to gauge the health and performance of applications and infrastructure. The metrics you mentioned are related to resource pressure on nodes in a computing environment. 
Memory and I/O have both waiting and stalled metrics, where CPU only has waiting. This is because a CPU is always executing a process.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of each:

1. **node_pressure_cpu_waiting_seconds_total**:
   - This metric measures the total time (in seconds) that processes have spent waiting for CPU resources due to CPU pressure. It indicates that the system is experiencing contention for CPU resources, potentially leading to performance degradation.

2. **node_pressure_cpu_stalled_seconds_total**:
   - This metric tracks the total time (in seconds) that processes have been stalled due to CPU pressure. Stalling usually means that tasks are not making progress because they cannot access the CPU. This can indicate a severe resource shortage or high load.

3. **node_pressure_io_stalled_seconds_total**:
   - This metric captures the total time (in seconds) that processes have been stalled waiting for I/O operations to complete. High values could indicate issues with disk performance or saturation of I/O resources.

4. **node_pressure_io_waiting_seconds_total**:
   - This metric counts the total time (in seconds) that processes have spent waiting for I/O resources (e.g., disk, network) to become available due to I/O pressure. Like the previous metric, it helps to identify potential bottlenecks in I/O operations.

5. **node_pressure_memory_stalled_seconds_total**:
   - This metric measures the total time (in seconds) that processes have been stalled due to memory pressure. This can happen when memory allocation requests cannot be fulfilled because of insufficient available memory.

6. **node_pressure_memory_waiting_seconds_total**:
   - This metric tracks the total time (in seconds) that processes have been waiting for memory resources to become available. High values might indicate that applications are competing for limited memory, which can lead to swapping or other performance issues.

### Summary
These metrics are crucial for diagnosing performance issues in a system. By monitoring them, you can identify when a node is under pressure and take proactive measures to alleviate bottlenecks, whether through scaling resources, optimizing workloads, or tuning application performance.
