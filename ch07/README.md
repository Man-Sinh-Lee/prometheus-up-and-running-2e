### Chapter 7: Node Exporter (Summary)

Chapter 7 describes the **Node Exporter**, a tool used to collect hardware and operating system metrics from Linux systems for Prometheus. It details various collectors within the Node Exporter that gather specific metrics about CPU, memory, network, and other hardware-related data.

#### **CPU Collector**:
- The **CPU collector** gathers metrics related to CPU usage, such as idle time, system time, user time, and time spent in different CPU modes (like I/O wait or interrupts). This collector provides insights into how CPU resources are being utilized across multiple cores.

#### **Filesystem Collector**:
- The **Filesystem collector** captures metrics about disk space usage, inodes, and free space on mounted filesystems. It is used to monitor disk capacity and ensure that filesystems are not running out of space.

#### **Diskstats Collector**:
- This collector focuses on **disk I/O statistics**, such as the number of reads and writes, average request size, and I/O time per disk. It helps in understanding the performance and health of disk storage by tracking read/write operations.

#### **Netdev Collector**:
- The **Netdev collector** gathers network interface statistics, including transmitted and received bytes, errors, dropped packets, and collisions. It helps monitor network traffic and the health of network interfaces.

#### **Meminfo Collector**:
- The **Meminfo collector** provides information on memory usage, including total, free, and available memory, as well as buffers and cached memory. It helps monitor system memory usage and ensure sufficient memory is available for applications.

#### **Hwmon Collector**:
- The **Hwmon collector** gathers hardware monitoring metrics, such as temperature, fan speed, and voltage from hardware sensors. It is especially useful for monitoring physical hardware conditions and preventing overheating.

#### **Stat Collector**:
- The **Stat collector** retrieves general system statistics from the `/proc/stat` file, which includes data on CPU usage, interrupts, context switches, and boot time. This collector provides a broad view of system performance and activity.

#### **Uname Collector**:
- The **Uname collector** gathers system information such as the operating system name, kernel version, and architecture. This metadata is helpful for identifying the system and tracking changes over time.

#### **OS Collector**:
- This collector provides metrics related to the operating system, including OS version and uptime. It helps track how long the system has been running and monitor system-level properties.

#### **LoadAvg Collector**:
- The **LoadAvg collector** gathers data about system load averages over 1, 5, and 15 minutes. Load averages indicate how many processes are actively running or waiting, providing a quick summary of system activity.

#### **Pressure Collector**:
- The **Pressure collector** captures metrics about resource pressure on the CPU, memory, and I/O. These metrics help in understanding how the system is handling demand and whether it is nearing saturation.

#### **Textfile Collector**:
- The **Textfile collector** allows for custom metrics to be collected by reading from files. It is used to expose metrics that are generated by scripts or external processes.
  - **Using the Textfile Collector**: To use this collector, metrics are written to a file in the Prometheus text exposition format, and the Node Exporter reads this file to expose the metrics to Prometheus.
  - **Timestamp**: This collector allows custom timestamps to be associated with metrics, which can be useful for tracking when the data was generated.

Chapter 7 provides detailed insights into the Node Exporter's collectors, which are essential for gathering a wide variety of system-level metrics, from CPU usage to hardware monitoring. These metrics form the foundation for monitoring system health and performance at a granular level.
