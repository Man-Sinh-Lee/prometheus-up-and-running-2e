The **Prometheus text format** and the **OpenMetrics format** are both used for exposing metrics data in time-series monitoring systems, but there are key differences between them. OpenMetrics was designed to extend and standardize Prometheus's format, incorporating improvements based on community feedback and use cases.

Here's a breakdown of both:

### 1. **Prometheus Text Format**
   - **Purpose**: Used by Prometheus to scrape metrics from applications.
   - **Structure**: The Prometheus text format consists of:
     - **Metric name**: Each metric is associated with a unique name.
     - **Labels**: Key-value pairs to provide metadata for the metrics.
     - **Values**: Metric values are either counters, gauges, histograms, or summaries.
     - **Comments**: Comments can be added using a `#` symbol.
     - **Timestamp**: Optional, can be provided along with the value.
   - **Example**:
     ```plaintext
     # HELP http_requests_total The total number of HTTP requests.
     # TYPE http_requests_total counter
     http_requests_total{method="post",code="200"} 1027
     http_requests_total{method="post",code="400"} 3
     ```

### 2. **OpenMetrics Format**
   - **Purpose**: A superset of Prometheus's text format, designed to be more flexible and extendable across different monitoring systems.
   - **Standardization**: OpenMetrics is an IETF standard and is intended to be universally adopted across different observability platforms, not just Prometheus.
   - **Features**:
     - **More detailed metadata**: OpenMetrics introduces more types of metadata to improve observability and compatibility.
     - **Consistency**: It has more stringent rules on format to avoid ambiguity and ensure cross-system compatibility.
     - **Histograms and Summaries**: Enhanced handling of histograms and summaries.
     - **Exemplars**: OpenMetrics introduces **exemplars** to track notable data points in histograms.
     - **End-of-stream marker**: OpenMetrics uses a line with `# EOF` to signify the end of the metrics stream.
   - **Example**:
     ```plaintext
     # HELP http_requests_total The total number of HTTP requests.
     # TYPE http_requests_total counter
     http_requests_total{method="post",code="200"} 1027.0 1600155600000
     http_requests_total{method="post",code="400"} 3.0 1600155600000
     # EOF
     ```

### Key Differences
1. **Standardization**:
   - Prometheus format is specific to Prometheus.
   - OpenMetrics is a more universal, standardized format for interoperability between various monitoring systems.

2. **Features**:
   - OpenMetrics supports features like **exemplars** and enforces strict syntax rules.
   - Prometheusâ€™s format is simpler but less feature-rich.

3. **Compatibility**:
   - OpenMetrics is backward-compatible with Prometheus, meaning Prometheus can scrape OpenMetrics format endpoints.
   - However, Prometheus text format does not support all the features of OpenMetrics.

### Adoption
   - Prometheus primarily uses its own format, but OpenMetrics is becoming the standard for future-forward monitoring systems as it is designed for broader industry use.

In summary, while the Prometheus text format is a solid, well-established format for Prometheus monitoring, OpenMetrics is a more feature-rich, standardized, and forward-thinking format intended for use beyond just Prometheus.
